							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am an enthusiastic person, with a ‘get up and go’ attitude. I
								have a passion for anything new or tech related. I am a social
								person and can easily integrate into many different types of
								groups. I have great communication skills and have no
								problem speaking in front of an audience.</p>
							<p>In my own time I enjoy coding and designing software and
								mobile applications, I have created my own mobile game
								using Unity 3D. I am currently in the process of creating some
								‘utility’ to help me further my knowledge into JavaScript and
								the React framework.</p>
